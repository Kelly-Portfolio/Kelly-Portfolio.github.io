        <p>My name is Kelly, and I am a strategic designer dedicated to contributing to a 
          sustainable and innovative future through strategic problem-solving and design. 
          I believe that whether a design is product- or service-oriented, it should empower 
          people to move towards a better future. Though the future is dynamic and ever-changing, 
          I am convinced that through teamwork, data-driven insights, and careful analysis of 
          markets, companies, competitors, and consumers, 
          a holistic vision can be developed to find the path to achieving the desired outcomes.</p>

        <p>My design journey began at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, 
          where I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Industrial Design and a Master’s 
          in Strategic Product Design. The Master’s program emphasizes a contextual and 
          user-centered approach to market integration, focusing on creating solutions that 
          are not only innovative but also feasible, usable, and desirable. This training has 
          equipped me to address complex 
          challenges by blending creativity with analytical thinking and structured methodologies.</p>

        <p>Studying at a technical university gave me a unique perspective, 
          blending rigorous technical knowledge with creative design thinking. 
          This combination shaped my approach, allowing me to balance functionality 
          with real-world application, while focusing 
          on data-driven problem-solving and iterative processes to arrive at effective solutions.</p>

        <p>During my Master’s, I expanded my global perspective by studying abroad for a year. 
          I spent a semester in Milan at Politecnico di Milano, where I deepened my design skills 
          and even published a paper. I also studied Chinese at Fudan University in Shanghai, 
          broadening my cultural understanding and adaptability to different environments—critical 
          skills when working on projects that span diverse industries and global markets.</p>

        <p>I also joined a Dream Team—a group of students who collaborated to design and 
          build machines for competitions. My team developed two machines: a traditional 
          electric race car and an autonomous electric race car. This experience refined 
          my abilities to work cross-functionally and manage tight deadlines, 
          while integrating various disciplines and stakeholders.</p>  

        <p>In my free time, I continually seek new challenges and opportunities to expand 
          my skill set. I have become proficient in Adobe software, 3D modeling, 
          and ventured into coding to create my own website. Beyond design, I enjoy 
          activities that challenge my analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities, 
          such as sports and games. These experiences have equipped me with the ability 
          to quickly and effectively learn new skills and adapt to fast-paced environments.</p>
