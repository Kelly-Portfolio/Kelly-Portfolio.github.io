        <p>My name is Kelly, and I am a strategic product designer driven to contribute to a sustainable and 
          innovative future through strategic design. I believe that whether a design is product- 
          or service-oriented, it should empower people to move towards a better future. Though the 
          future is dynamic and ever-changing, I am convinced that through teamwork and careful analysis 
          of companies, competitors, contexts, and consumers, a holistic vision can be developed to find the path 
          to achieving the desired outcomes.</p>

        <p>My design journey began at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, where I earned my 
          bachelor's degree in Industrial Design Engineering and a master's in Strategic Product Design. 
          The master’s program focuses on a contextual approach to market and user placement of products and services. 
          Although Delft is not a dedicated design school, I found that studying at a technical university offered a 
          unique advantage: a strong focus on feasibility, usability, and desirability in design.</p>

        <p>During my studies, I pushed myself further by joining a Dream Team—a group of students who collaborate 
          for a year to design and build machines for competitions. My team worked on developing two machines: 
          a traditional electric race car and an autonomous electric race car.</p>  

        <p>In my free time, I like to seek new challenges and opportunities to expand my skill set. 
          I have become proficient in Adobe software, 3D modelling, and even ventured into areas outside my comfort zone, 
          like coding to create my own website. Beyond design, I enjoy activities that broaden my cultural awareness, 
          such as visiting museums and travelling, as well as sports and games that challenge my problem-solving skills. 
          These experiences have equipped me with the ability to quickly and effectively learn new skills.</p>
