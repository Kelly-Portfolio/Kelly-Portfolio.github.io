H1: Finding a New Opportunity in China
H1h1: The Challenge
H1h1text: Rural citizens in China often distrust local doctors, preferring to travel long distances to cities for medical treatment, even at significant financial cost. Barco, with its expertise in medical devices, presented an opportunity to bridge this gap by making healthcare more accessible and equitable for rural populations.
H1h2: Key Questions Addressed
keqQuestAdress: Yes
H1h3: Findings and Insights
H1h3text: Our analysis revealed that Barco's presence in China had stagnated over the past five years, highlighting the need to rethink its market approach. Through extensive desk research and interviews, we identified a significant gap in medical infrastructure in rural China, providing a clear direction for our design process.
H1h4: Vision
H1h4text: Our vision was to empower rural doctors in China, enhancing their ability to diagnose and treat patients effectively. By doing so, these doctors could act as the first line of defense, reducing the need for costly and time-consuming trips to urban centers. The solution envisioned was a network of rural doctors equipped with advanced diagnostic tools provided by Barco, allowing them to collaborate remotely with city doctors. In the next figures, it is shown how Barco would intervene in the new situation.

H2: "Barco Echo: Connecting Rural Doctors"
H2h1: The Solution
H2h1text: We developed Barco Echo, a Doppler Echo Cardiogram product-service system tailored to the needs of rural healthcare providers in China. This system enables rural doctors to communicate seamlessly with their counterparts in urban hospitals, leveraging Barco's cutting-edge imaging technology. A video has been made to show the PSS in use, shown at the top of the page

H2h2: Strategic Partnership
H2h2text: Recognizing Barco's limitations in entering the Chinese market alone, we proposed a partnership with SonoScape, a Chinese company specializing in echocardiogram machines for urban hospitals. This collaboration would enable both companies to expand their market reach, bringing advanced medical care to underserved rural communities.
H2h3: Future Expansion
H2h3text: While the initial focus of Barco Echo was on China, the concept has broader applications in other rural areas worldwide, such as Russia and Africa. To support this global vision, we developed a roadmap outlining the long-term strategy for scaling the product-service system beyond China.

H2h4: Conclusion
H2h4text: This project demonstrates my ability to conduct thorough market analysis, collaborate effectively within a team, and develop innovative solutions that address real-world challenges. It also showcases my strategic thinking in identifying and leveraging partnerships to maximize impact.  In the end, the client wanted us to continue with the project and offered two internships to our Chinese colleagues.
