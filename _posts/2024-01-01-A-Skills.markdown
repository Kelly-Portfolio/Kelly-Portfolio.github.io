ProjectOverview: I’m always eager to improve myself and acquire new skills, whether design-related or not. Learning is a passion I pursue in my free time. In this section, I’ll highlight the design-related skills I’ve acquired independently, which have yet to be utilized in my other projects.

SkillList: Yes

H1: High Detail Rendering
H1h1text: In the past, I’ve created renders using SolidWorks Visualize and Keyshot 9, focusing on objects with smooth surfaces like plastic and metals. To push my boundaries, I decided to take on the challenge of rendering less smooth surfaces, such as wood and soft textures. For this, I turned to Blender, a 3D modeling software often used for sculptures and intricate models, unlike SolidWorks, which is geared towards producible artifacts and physics calculations.

H2: Digital Drawing
H2h1text: While I’ve incorporated digital drawing into other projects, it hasn’t been the main focus until now. In this section, I wanted to highlight these skills. Using a drawing tablet and Photoshop, I’ve created detailed sketches.
