ProjectOverview: Spirulina, a nutrient-rich algae that can be easily added to food without compromising taste, is poised to become the next big trend in the health food industry. Spireaux, a young startup, aims to capitalize on this trend by introducing a new spirulina-based drink that showcases the potential of this superfood. Our brief was to design a new brand and product to help Spireaux realize its vision. This project was completed as part of the Brand and Product Commercialization course during my master's program. The team, consisting of four students, worked over 10 weeks to deliver a comprehensive presentation and final report, which included brand positioning and a launch campaign. Our brief was to design a new brand and product for this company to realize its dream.

H1: Spirulina Meets the Market
H1h1: Market Analysis
H1h1text: To effectively position Spireaux in the market, we conducted a 4C analysis, examining the company (brand and product), competitors, consumers, and the broader market context. This analysis revealed that self-improving casual sport enthusiasts, who value health, sustainability, and convenience, represent the ideal target audience. These consumers are part of a growing movement focused on health and sustainability, and they appreciate products that are both ready-made and easy to consume. Using the strengths of Spireaux, it is possible to create a unique product that they would seek out.

H2: A Spark Among the Brands
H2h1: Brand Strategy
H2h1text: "To differentiate Spireaux from its competitors, we strategically positioned the brand using a competition grid. This grid plotted two key axes: Refreshing (fulfillment after an activity) versus Perform (enhancing one’s capabilities), and Tasty (low barrier to entry) versus Effective (aligning with an ambitious mindset). The intersection of these qualities led to the creation of Spark, a brand designed for ambitious, self-improving casual athletes who lead hectic lives. The Spark brand is approachable, confident, and spirited, as reflected in its brand DNA and logo design."
