ProjectOverview: In todayâ€™s world, nearly 60% of consumers discard their electronics instead of opting for repairs, contributing to substantial waste and loss of value. This behavior underscores the need for a shift towards a circular economy, where products are maintained and reused to extend their lifecycle. My Master's thesis focused on addressing this issue by exploring the circular economy, analyzing consumer behavior, and understanding the broader sustainability context, particularly in relation to electronic devices.
