ProjectOverview: In today’s world, nearly 60% of consumers discard their electronics instead of opting for repairs, contributing to substantial waste and loss of value. This behavior underscores the need for a shift towards a circular economy, where products are maintained and reused to extend their lifecycle. My Master's thesis focused on addressing this issue by exploring the circular economy, analyzing consumer behavior, and understanding the broader sustainability context, particularly in relation to electronic devices. again

deliverables: A report, a final presentation, and a video

H1: Challenging the Non-Repair Culture
H1h1: Research Approach
H1h1text: To gain a comprehensive perspective on the problem, I conducted extensive literature reviews and field research on existing sustainability initiatives. This dual approach allowed me to deeply understand how people experience sustainability and interact with their electronic products. It also provided specialized knowledge of the key stakeholders involved in promoting repair culture.

H1h2: Key Findings and Consumer Insights
H1h2text: My research led to the organization of activities aimed at boosting repair willingness, which I mapped into a consumer decision-making model called the I-change model. Alongside a SWOT analysis, this model revealed four key opportunities to enhance consumers' willingness to repair their electronics, which are outlined in the following section.

H1h2img2text: Four identified key opportunities above and the current context below

H2: Opportunities for the Future
H2h1: Defining the Vision
H2h1text: While identifying the four key opportunities, it became clear that these insights needed a cohesive direction to shape a compelling vision for change. To conceptualize this vision, I used an analogy "the design should inspire the same pride and excitement users feel when showcasing their driving skills after obtaining a driver’s license". This analogy guided the development of a design that not only meets the identified opportunities but also resonates emotionally with users.

H2h2: Design Requirements
H2h2text: The insights gathered from consumer behavior studies and theories on repair willingness formed the basis for four categories of design requirements. These requirements were critical in shaping a design that would effectively encourage consumers to repair their electronics rather than discard them.
