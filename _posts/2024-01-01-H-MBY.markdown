ProjectOverview: In today’s world, nearly 60% of consumers discard their electronics instead of opting for repairs, contributing to substantial waste and loss of value. This behavior underscores the need for a shift towards a circular economy, where products are maintained and reused to extend their lifecycle. My master's thesis focused on addressing this issue by exploring the circular economy, analyzing consumer behavior, and understanding the broader sustainability context, particularly in relation to electronic devices.

H1: Challenging the Non-Repair Culture
H1h1: Research Approach
H1h1text: To gain a comprehensive perspective on the problem, I conducted extensive literature reviews and field research on existing sustainability initiatives. This dual approach allowed me to deeply understand how people experience sustainability and interact with their electronic products. It also provided specialized knowledge of the key stakeholders involved in promoting repair culture.

H1h2: Key Findings and Consumer Insights
H1h2text: My research led to the organization of activities aimed at boosting repair willingness, which I mapped into a consumer decision-making model called the I-change model. Alongside a SWOT analysis, this model revealed four key opportunities to enhance consumers' willingness to repair their electronics, which are outlined in the following section.

H2: Opportunities for the Future
H2h1: Defining the Vision
H2h1text: "While identifying the four key opportunities, it became clear that these insights needed a cohesive direction to shape a compelling vision for change. To conceptualize this vision, I used an analogy: the design should inspire the same pride and excitement users feel when showcasing their driving skills after obtaining a driver’s license. This analogy guided the development of a design that not only meets the identified opportunities but also resonates emotionally with users."

H2h2: Design Requirements
H2h2text: The insights gathered from consumer behavior studies and theories on repair willingness formed the basis for four categories of design requirements. These requirements were critical in shaping a design that would effectively encourage consumers to repair their electronics rather than discard them.

H3: Creating Paths Forward
H3h1: Ideation Process
H3h1text: To develop a design that is desirable, feasible, and viable, I engaged in multiple ideation iterations. Techniques such as morphological charts, problem statements, brainstorming, and SCAMPER were employed to generate a wide range of ideas. Through this iterative process, I refined the concepts down to four final ideas, ultimately combining the most successful elements of two into a single, cohesive concept.

H4: "Assemblable Electronics: A Proof of Concept"
H4h1text: The final concept, "Made-By-You," is an innovative product-service system (PSS) where users are empowered to design and assemble their own electronics. The product arrives in easily assemblable parts, allowing users to quickly and effortlessly put it together, thereby fostering familiarity with the product and basic handiwork skills. This system also enables customization without the need for a traditional assembly line.

H4h2: Service Integration
H4h2text: Accompanying the product is a comprehensive service, in the form of an application, that guides users through the assembly process and assists with repairs. This service centralizes information that is typically scattered across various channels into a single, user-friendly application, lowering the barrier for those who wish to repair their products. By creating a central hub of streamlined information, the service simplifies the repair process, making it more accessible and less intimidating for consumers.

H4h3: From Concept to Prototype
H4h3text: To make the concept more tangible and easier to discuss, a proof of concept was developed. The prototype is based on the Philips Senseo coffee machine. By integrating guidelines from literature on assembly, disassembly, repair, and instructions, the Senseo was redesigned to be easy to assemble and disassemble, supported by an enhanced manual. The redesigned Senseo is also made transparent, fostering a deeper connection between the user and the product.

H4h4: Impact and User Experience
H4h4text: The "Made-By-You" concept not only increases user awareness of a product's components through the assembly process but also indirectly encourages consideration of repairs. By providing a central hub for all product-related information, the repair process becomes more straightforward and approachable. To enhance the story and user experience, I created two user journeys, which have also been transformed into a short video shown at the top of this page, along with a detailed service blueprint that outlines the behind-the-scenes activities necessary to support the PSS.
