H1: EarthScope

H1h1text: Observing Earth from space offers a unique perspective that can foster a deep sense of environmental responsibility—an experience known as the overview effect. Traditionally, only astronauts and space scientists have access to this awe-inspiring view, but Virtual Reality (VR) can bring this experience to everyone, encouraging a broader understanding of the planet’s fragility and the urgency of environmental protection.
client1: Blekinge Institute of Technology
course1: Virtual and Physical Prototyping
duration1: 10 weeks
team1: 4 students
deliverables1: VR application prototype, video showcase, a report, and a presentation
H1h2: The Challenge
H1h2text: In this course, provided by Politecnico di Milano, the challenge was to design a VR application that inspires sustainability through the overview effect. Our project, EarthScope, aimed to create a platform where users could virtually explore Earth from space, gaining insights into environmental issues like deforestation and resource depletion. By allowing users to see the planet from this vantage point, EarthScope promotes a consciousness of the need to protect our environment in everyday life.
H1h3: Outcomes
H1h3text: The final prototype effectively conveyed the overview effect, making users more aware of environmental issues.

H2: Olvarit App
H2h1text: Balancing convenience and control is a major challenge for parents when it comes to their baby’s diet. While commercial baby food offers convenience, many parents are concerned about the lack of control over its contents. On the other hand, preparing homemade baby food can be stressful and time-consuming, especially when parents are unsure if they’re providing the right nutrients.
course2: Food and Eating Design
duration2: 2 weeks
team2: Individual
deliverables2: Poster
H2h2: The Challenge
H2h2text: I challenged myself to reimagine how Olvarit baby food could be experienced by parents, addressing the dilemma between convenience and control. The solution needed to provide parents with confidence in their child’s nutrition while reducing the stress associated with meal preparation.
H2h3: Outcomes
H2h3text: I designed a service that allows parents to plan their child’s meals using Olvarit’s expertise. The app provides customized meal plans and delivers a package with the required produce and preparation instructions. This service empowers parents to make informed decisions about their child’s diet, reducing uncertainty and stress.

H3: PREG-POD

H3h1text: Speculative design allows us to explore and reflect on possible futures by creating artifacts that challenge our current perceptions and values. In this project, we were tasked with envisioning a future scenario based on trend research and developing an artifact that prompts people to reconsider the implications of emerging technologies.
course3: Design Futures
duration3: 4 weeks
team3: 7 students
deliverables3: concept catalogue, video showcase, and public presentation
H3h2: The Future
H3h2text: The PREG-POD concept explores a future where most pregnancies occur in laboratories due to medical risks and career demands. Despite this shift, the desire for intimacy and traditional family structures persists. PREG-POD enables shared pregnancy experiences among multiple co-parents, where each parent contributes genetically to the embryo, which grows within the PREG-POD.
H3h3: The Artifact
H3h3text: PREG-POD reimagines family dynamics by allowing multiple parents to bond with the baby during the pregnancy, regardless of gender. It includes features like nutritional fluid, a digital interface for monitoring, and modes for stimulation and sleep. The concept video showcasing the possibilities of future family models, along with the public's opinions, is shown above.
