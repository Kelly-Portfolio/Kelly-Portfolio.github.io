H1: Rethinking the Indoor Climate
H1h1: Research and Analysis
H1h1text: To gain a comprehensive understanding of the indoor climate industry, I began by exploring and analyzing the field of indoor heat pumps. Through user research, which included interviews and surveys, I identified key customer values and needs. The primary outcomes of this research phase were the creation of a detailed customer persona and an overview of how the indoor climate is currently managed. These insights informed the development of a vision to position Inventum as the go-to brand for all aspects of a healthy indoor climate.

H2: A Breath of Fresh Air
H2h1: Design Process
H2h1text: The ideation phase involved creating numerous sketches and concepts, many of which were either refined or discarded to arrive at the best solution. This iterative process led to the development of the Inventum Sens-Air, a modular air sensor system. Each module of the Sens-Air contains a specific type of sensor, allowing users to mix and match modules to create a customized product that meets their individual needs.

H2h3: Conclusion
H2h3text: The project demonstrates my ability to tackle complex challenges within the field of sustainable living. By thoroughly researching the indoor climate industry and identifying user needs, I was able to design the Inventum Sens-Air, a modular air sensor system that aligns with both customer values and Inventumâ€™s commitment to sustainability. This project showcases my skills in research, analysis, and iterative design, culminating in a solution that offers both flexibility and a healthier indoor environment. Through this project, I have further developed my ability to create innovative products that not only meet functional requirements but also contribute to a more sustainable future.
